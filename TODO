need both percent overlap of reference and query

maybe add min/max-distance filter to combiner?

fix reference counts to find alignments that overlap splice junction

make file isn't the greatest.  rules like splat-unaligned and split-unaligned*.supersplat aren't working correctly.  is make the proper tool?

use JSONValueProtocol instead?  removes leading null and tab, which are in almost every output

unit tests for gff filter

gff filter doesn't handle invalid gff records/files

weighted coverage

model-tidy, given multiple gff files, output one that's been cleaned up
  - detect and resolve duplicate IDs (by appending -N)
  - related features are grouped
  - invalid lines are removed
  - genes with no mRNA children are removed

file bug with mrjob:
    if sort fails on unix (because of something like a full tmp dir) it will try again
    with piping (which is meant for windows compat.) but really it's just going to fail
    again.  also, a sort fail could mention sort-stderr or print out a useful message
