jobs for running cashx, splat, stack, gmb?
  probably need to run file split before splat


fix splat strand output to +/-
  test this on pseudo0


model-tidy, given multiple gff files, output one that's been cleaned up
  - detect and resolve duplicate IDs (by appending -N)
  - related features are grouped
  - invalid lines are removed
  - genes with no mRNA children are removed


test funcs run job code could be abstracted slightly
    f = dummy('filename')
    j = JobClass(args=[]).sandbox(f)
    j.run_job()
    out = j.parse_output()

    to

    out = test_job(JobClass, 'filename', args)

    def test_job():
        ...
        return j.parse_output(JobClass.OUTPUT_PROTOCOL)
