test funcs run job code could be abstracted slightly
    f = dummy('filename')
    j = JobClass(args=[]).sandbox(f)
    j.run_job()
    out = j.parse_output()

    to

    out = test_job(JobClass, 'filename', args)

    def test_job():
        ...
        return j.parse_output(JobClass.OUTPUT_PROTOCOL)
